# MERN Stack Employee Management Application

This is a MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack application for managing employees.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Node.js, npm and MongoDB installed on your machine. You can check and monitor your database using these commands after installing mongoDB:

```bash

systemctl status mongod
systemctl start mongod
mongosh
show dbs;
use 101394258_comp3123_assignment2_reactjs;
show collections;
db.employeesCollection.find() [or any other transaction]

```

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Onigiri0998/101394258_comp3123_assignment2_reactjs.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd 101394258_comp3123_assignment2_reactjs
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Run the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

This will concurrently run the server and the client application.
